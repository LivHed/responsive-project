### About 
The page are showing an imaginary retreat for teams that needs to unplug and take a break from their workplace, including obstacle courses to go through together to get closer as a team, and also just relax. They will stay in bungalows in a beautiful scenic natural area while doing so. 

### Notes
The button 'download itinerary' are just to show what could be included on the page. Nothing happens when you click that button. Lorem Ipsum text are used on the FAQ page as examples of how those text areas would look like, since itÂ´s not a real company the website is built for. Real contact details are not added either, for the same reason.
